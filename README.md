# glsl2hlsl

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

A GLSL-to-HLSL converter written in pure Zig 0.17.0. It does not call shaderc, SPIRV-Cross, or DXC: it preprocesses GLSL, parses it into an AST, and emits HLSL directly.

The project builds as a library with a C ABI and a header-only C++ wrapper. The C header requires C23; the C++ wrapper requires C++23 and is tested with C++26. Stage 1 covers common vertex and fragment shader constructs: uniforms and samplers, stage inputs and outputs, matrix and vector constructors, common intrinsics, texture sampling, and control flow.

## Requirements

- Zig 0.17.0
- C23 for C consumers
- C++23 or newer for C++ consumers; C++26 is tested

The installed headers reject older language standards at compile time.

## Build

```powershell
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Artifacts:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `zig-out\lib\glsl2hlsl.lib` | Static library |
| `zig-out\include\glsl2hlsl\glsl2hlsl.h` | C23 header |
| `zig-out\include\glsl2hlsl\glsl2hlsl.hpp` | C++23 header-only wrapper |

Use `-Dshared=true` for a DLL and import library, or `-Dcli=true` to also build the command-line tool.

## Usage

```cpp
#include <glsl2hlsl/glsl2hlsl.hpp>

glsl2hlsl::Result result =
    glsl2hlsl::convert(source, glsl2hlsl::Stage::Fragment);

if (!result) {
    for (const auto &diagnostic : result.diagnostics) {
        // diagnostic.line / column / message
    }
}
std::cout << result.output;
```

The C ABI owns the result memory; release it with `glsl2hlsl_result_free`. The C++ wrapper handles that automatically.

```c
glsl2hlsl_result result = {};
if (glsl2hlsl_convert(source, length, GLSL2HLSL_STAGE_FRAGMENT, &result)
        == GLSL2HLSL_STATUS_OK) {
    fwrite(result.output, 1, result.output_length, stdout);
}
glsl2hlsl_result_free(&result);
```

Command-line tool:

```powershell
zig build -Dcli=true
.\zig-out\bin\glsl2hlsl.exe shader.vert
.\zig-out\bin\glsl2hlsl.exe shader.frag -o shader.hlsl -s fragment
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is currently in Chinese:

- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md): project overview and layout
- [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md): CLI, stage inference, and Zig API
- [docs/cpp-api.md](docs/cpp-api.md): C ABI, C++ wrapper, linking, and ownership
- [docs/design.md](docs/design.md): implementation and design decisions
- [docs/glsl-hlsl-mapping.md](docs/glsl-hlsl-mapping.md): GLSL-to-HLSL mapping rules

See [README_zh.md](README_zh.md) for this README in Chinese.

## Testing

```powershell
zig build test
zig build c-test
zig build cpp-test
powershell -File tests/run.ps1
```

`cpp-test` builds the same interoperability test with both `-std=c++23` and `-std=c++26`. `tests/run.ps1` also converts every shader under `tests/shaders` and `examples`, validating the output with `dxc.exe` when it is available.

## Limitations

Stage 1 does not support UBO/SSBO blocks, geometry/tessellation/compute shaders, function overloading, dynamic matrix indexing, or image atomics. See the "Unsupported features" section of the mapping document for the full list.
